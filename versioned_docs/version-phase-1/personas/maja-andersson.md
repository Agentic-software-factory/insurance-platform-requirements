# Maja Andersson, 52 — Estate Executor (Dödsboförvaltare)

## Avatar Description

A woman in her early fifties with reading glasses pushed up onto her head,
sitting at a kitchen table covered with folders of paperwork — estate inventory
forms, a death certificate, and insurance correspondence. A cup of tea sits
untouched beside her laptop, which shows a Skatteverket bouppteckning page. She
looks tired but determined, holding a pen and making notes on a printed list of
her father's accounts and policies.

| Estate coverage     | Deceased father Sven (78) held helförsäkring on a 2005 Volvo V70 with TryggFörsäkring for 30+ years                                       |
| Vehicle             | 2005 Volvo V70 (registered to the estate of Sven Andersson)                                                                               |
| Bonus class         | 7 (decades claim-free)                                                                                                                    |
| Estate status       | Maja is appointed boutredningsman; the car is parked at Sven's house pending transfer to her brother Erik, who plans to sell it           |
| Temporary coverage  | Trafikförsäkring must remain active on the Volvo V70 until the vehicle is formally deregistered at Transportstyrelsen or transferred/sold |
| Maja's own coverage | Insured with Länsförsäkringar — she is not a TryggFörsäkring customer herself                                                             |

## Goals

- Get a clear, consolidated overview of all policies her father held with
  TryggFörsäkring so she can cancel or transfer each one without missing
  anything
- Understand exactly what documentation is required — death certificate
  (dödsbevis), estate inventory (bouppteckning), proof of executor role — so she
  can gather everything in one round rather than being asked for additional
  documents repeatedly
- Ensure the prepaid premium is correctly refunded to the estate's bank account,
  with a transparent calculation of the unused coverage period
- Keep trafikförsäkring active on her father's Volvo V70 during the estate
  settlement period so the car remains legally covered while parked, then cancel
  or transfer the policy when her brother takes ownership
- Complete the entire process with empathetic, respectful service — she should
  not have to repeat the circumstances of her father's death to multiple
  departments or agents

## Frustrations / Pain Points

- **Emotional burden compounded by bureaucracy** — Maja is grieving while
  simultaneously navigating Skatteverket, banks, Transportstyrelsen, and now
  insurance; each institution has its own forms, timelines, and requirements,
  and none of them coordinate with each other
- **No single point of contact** — she fears being transferred between
  departments (cancellations, claims, billing) and having to re-explain the
  death each time, which is both painful and inefficient
- **Unclear documentation requirements** — she does not know upfront whether
  TryggFörsäkring needs the original dödsbevis or a copy, whether the
  bouppteckning must be registered with Skatteverket first, or whether a
  fullmakt from other heirs is required
- **Temporary coverage confusion** — Maja knows the car must stay insured but is
  unsure whether the existing policy automatically continues, whether she needs
  to sign a new agreement as estate representative, or whether the premium
  changes during the settlement period
- **Refund complexity** — she needs the unused premium refunded to the estate
  account (not her father's now-frozen personal account) and worries the refund
  will be delayed or sent to the wrong account without clear instructions

## Tech Comfort Level

**Medium.** Maja uses digital tools daily at work (electronic medical records,
scheduling systems) and for personal banking via BankID. She is comfortable
navigating online portals and submitting documents digitally. However, for a
sensitive and unfamiliar process like estate insurance cancellation, she would
prefer a guided experience — either a step-by-step online flow with clear
instructions or a single phone call with a knowledgeable agent who can handle
everything. She does not want to figure out the process through trial and error.

## Regulatory Touchpoints

| Regulation | Relevance                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **FSA**    | Trafikförsäkring must remain active on the estate vehicle until it is formally deregistered at Transportstyrelsen or ownership is transferred to a new registered keeper (FSA-007).                          |
| **FSA**    | The estate is entitled to a fair refund of unused premium for the remaining coverage period after cancellation, calculated pro rata (FSA-004).                                                               |
| **GDPR**   | The deceased person's personal data is subject to retention rules; the estate representative has the right to access policy and claims information necessary for estate administration (GDPR-001, GDPR-003). |
| **GDPR**   | Death certificates and estate inventory documents contain sensitive personal data that must be processed with appropriate safeguards and retained only as long as necessary (GDPR-004).                      |

## Related Actors

- [Customer (Privatkund)](../actors/internal/customer.md) — Maja's father Sven
  was the original policyholder; Maja interacts with TryggFörsäkring as his
  estate representative, not as a customer herself.
- [Transportstyrelsen](../actors/external/transportstyrelsen.md) — the estate
  must coordinate vehicle deregistration or ownership transfer with
  Transportstyrelsen before the motor policy can be fully cancelled.
