# Maja Andersson, 52 — Dödsboförvaltare (Estate Executor)

> _"My father just passed away, and between the grief and the paperwork, I need
> the insurance company to guide me — not make me guess what documents I need or
> how long the car stays covered."_

## Avatar Description

A woman in her early fifties, looking composed but tired, sitting at a kitchen
table surrounded by folders of documents — estate inventory papers, a death
certificate, vehicle registration printouts. A half-empty coffee cup sits
nearby. Her expression is determined but emotionally drained.

## Insurance Situation

Maja is not a TryggFörsäkring customer herself — she is insured with
Länsförsäkringar. She interacts with TryggFörsäkring solely as the estate
executor (boutredningsman) for her deceased father Sven Andersson (78), who was
a customer for over 30 years.

| Relationship          | Estate executor (dödsboförvaltare/boutredningsman) for deceased policyholder          |
| Deceased policyholder | Sven Andersson, 78, TryggFörsäkring customer for 30+ years                            |
| Estate policy         | Helförsäkring on a 2016 Volvo V70 — policy must be cancelled or transferred           |
| Bonus class           | Class 7 (Sven had 30+ years claim-free)                                               |
| Immediate need        | Cancel policy, obtain premium refund to estate, maintain trafikförsäkring temporarily |
| Vehicle disposition   | Transfer car to Maja's brother, who will sell it                                      |

## Goals

- Understand exactly which documents are required (death certificate, estate
  inventory, power of attorney) so she can gather everything in one go
- Cancel her father's motor insurance and receive a fair refund of prepaid
  premium to the estate's bank account
- Ensure the Volvo remains covered by trafikförsäkring during the estate
  settlement period until the vehicle is transferred or deregistered
- Transfer the policy or vehicle registration to her brother before sale, with
  minimal administrative burden
- Complete the entire process through digital channels where possible, avoiding
  repeated phone calls while managing work and grief

## Frustrations / Pain Points

- **Unclear documentation requirements** — no upfront checklist of what the
  estate executor needs to provide; each phone call reveals a new document
  requirement
- **Emotional insensitivity in process design** — automated messages addressed
  to her deceased father, renewal reminders sent to a dead person's email, and
  generic hold-queue experiences during an already difficult time
- **Temporary coverage uncertainty** — the car is parked at her father's house
  but still needs trafikförsäkring; Maja is unsure if coverage continues
  automatically or if she needs to take action to avoid a gap
- **Refund opacity** — no clear explanation of how the unused premium is
  calculated, when the refund will be paid, or to which account
- **Multiple touchpoints** — cancellation, refund, vehicle transfer, and
  trafikförsäkring continuation all seem to involve different departments with
  no coordinated estate-handling process

## Tech Comfort Level

**Medium.** Maja is comfortable with BankID, internet banking, and digital
health services through her work. She prefers handling administrative tasks
online during evenings after work, rather than calling during office hours. She
uses a laptop and smartphone but is not interested in installing dedicated apps
for a one-time interaction. A clear web-based self-service flow with status
tracking would suit her needs best.

## Regulatory Touchpoints

| Regulation | Relevance                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **FSA**    | Trafikförsäkring must remain active on the Volvo until the vehicle is deregistered with Transportstyrelsen or transferred to a new owner (FSA-007).                                               |
| **FSA**    | Fair refund calculation for the unused premium period after cancellation; the estate is entitled to a pro-rata refund (FSA-004).                                                                  |
| **GDPR**   | The deceased person's personal data is subject to retention rules; the estate representative has a right to access policy and claims data relevant to estate administration (GDPR-001, GDPR-003). |
| **GDPR**   | The death certificate and estate inventory documents are sensitive personal data requiring appropriate handling and storage (GDPR-004).                                                           |
