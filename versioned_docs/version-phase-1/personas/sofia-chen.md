# Sofia Chen, 32 — Recent Immigrant

## Avatar Description

A young professional woman standing near a parked car, holding both a German and
a Swedish driving license. She looks determined but slightly frustrated, reading
a document in Swedish with a translation app on her phone.

## Demographics

| Field      | Details                                      |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Age        | 32                                           |
| Location   | Malmö, Sweden                                |
| Occupation | Software engineer at a multinational company |
| Income     | Upper-middle, professional salary            |

## Insurance Situation

| Field            | Details                                                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Current coverage | None in Sweden — had helförsäkring in Germany for 7 years                 |
| Vehicle          | 2021 BMW 3 Series (brought from Germany, re-registered in Sweden)         |
| Bonus class      | Would be SF-Klasse 7 in Germany (roughly equivalent to Swedish class 5–6) |
| Coverage goal    | Helförsäkring with transferred bonus class from German insurer            |

## Goals

- Transfer her German no-claims bonus (Schadenfreiheitsklasse) to a Swedish
  bonus class so she does not start at class 0
- Understand the Swedish insurance system — coverage tiers, terminology, and
  regulatory requirements — without needing fluent Swedish
- Complete the insurance purchase process in English or with clear bilingual
  support
- Re-register her German car in Sweden and get insured seamlessly as part of
  that process

## Frustrations / Pain Points

- **Bonus class transfer** — the process for proving foreign claims history is
  unclear; different insurers have different requirements for documentation
  from the German insurer
- **Language barrier** — policy documents, terms, and conditions are only
  available in Swedish; online translation tools struggle with insurance
  jargon
- **System unfamiliarity** — the Swedish insurance tiers (trafikförsäkring,
  halvförsäkring, helförsäkring) do not map directly to the German system
  (Haftpflicht, Teilkasko, Vollkasko), causing confusion
- **Re-registration complexity** — coordinating vehicle re-registration with
  Transportstyrelsen and insurance purchase involves multiple steps with
  different authorities
- **Distrust of starting over** — being offered class 0 pricing despite 7
  years of claim-free driving feels punitive and may push her to competitors
  who accept foreign history

## Tech Comfort Level

**High.** Sofia is a software engineer and comfortable with any digital
interface. She prefers online self-service and expects a modern, well-designed
experience. She authenticates with BankID (obtained after receiving her Swedish
personnummer). Language toggle or English-language support is important.

## Regulatory Touchpoints

| Regulation | Relevance                                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **IDD**    | Demands-and-needs assessment (IDD-001) must account for Sofia's existing coverage history and specific situation as a new entrant to the Swedish market.               |
| **IDD**    | Pre-contractual information (IDD-003) should be comprehensible; providing information in English supports the "clear, fair, and not misleading" requirement.           |
| **FSA**    | Trafikförsäkring is mandatory (FSA-007); Sofia must be insured before driving her re-registered vehicle on Swedish roads.                                              |
| **FSA**    | TFF manages the bonus class transfer process between insurers, including cross-border transfers (FSA-008).                                                             |
| **GDPR**   | Sofia's personal data includes foreign documents (German driving license, insurance history); processing requires lawful basis and transparent information (GDPR-001). |
| **GDPR**   | Cross-border data transfer from the German insurer must comply with GDPR data transfer rules (GDPR-001).                                                               |
