# Henrik & Wilma Nilsson, 48/17 — Tonårsförare (Teen Driver)

> _"I'm happy Wilma got her license, but I'm terrified of what it'll cost — and
> what happens to my bonus if she has a fender bender on her way to school."_

## Avatar Description

A middle-aged man in work clothes standing in a residential driveway next to a
dark blue 2019 Kia Ceed, handing car keys to a teenage girl with a backpack over
one shoulder. She looks excited; he looks proud but slightly worried. A
gymnasium school bag is visible in the back seat.

## Insurance Situation

| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Current coverage | Halvförsäkring on the family's secondary car                                                   |
| Vehicle          | 2019 Kia Ceed (secondary family car, Wilma's daily driver)                                     |
| Bonus class      | Henrik: class 5 on this vehicle (long claim-free history)                                      |
| Situation        | Wilma recently obtained her B-körkort and will drive to school and her part-time job           |
| Coverage goal    | Add Wilma as a named driver; understand premium impact and whether to upgrade to helförsäkring |

## Goals

- Add Wilma as a named driver on the Kia Ceed policy with a clear understanding
  of the premium increase before confirming the change
- Understand exactly whose bonus class is at risk if Wilma causes an accident —
  Henrik wants to protect his class 5 bonus built over many claim-free years
- Evaluate whether the coverage should be upgraded from halvförsäkring to
  helförsäkring now that an inexperienced driver will use the car daily
- Find out if TryggFörsäkring offers any young-driver programmes, telematics
  discounts, or mileage-based pricing that could reduce the premium impact
- Keep total insurance costs manageable on a single income while ensuring Wilma
  has adequate protection for her daily commute

## Frustrations / Pain Points

- **Premium sticker shock** — adding a 17-year-old driver to the policy could
  double or triple the premium, and Henrik has no way to preview the cost before
  committing to the change
- **Bonus class uncertainty** — it is unclear whether Wilma's at-fault accident
  would reduce Henrik's personal bonus class or only affect the vehicle's policy
  rating
- **Coverage gap anxiety** — halvförsäkring does not cover damage to the
  insured's own vehicle in a single-car accident, which worries Henrik given
  Wilma's inexperience
- **Complex process** — adding a named driver requires documentation (Wilma's
  driving licence, personal data) and Henrik is unsure what is needed and how
  long it takes
- **Parental responsibility** — Henrik feels responsible for ensuring Wilma is
  properly covered but finds it difficult to compare coverage options without
  clear cost breakdowns

## Tech Comfort Level

**Henrik: Medium.** Henrik uses digital banking and BankID daily but prefers
phone support for complex insurance questions. He is comfortable navigating a
web portal for routine tasks such as viewing policy details or downloading
documents, but would want human guidance when making significant policy changes
like adding a driver.

**Wilma: High.** Wilma is a digital native who handles everything on her
smartphone. She expects to be able to view her driving coverage, access her
digital insurance card, and contact support via chat — not by calling a phone
number. She would find a mobile app far more natural than a desktop portal.

## Regulatory Touchpoints

| Regulation | Relevance                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **GDPR**   | Processing Wilma's personal data (driving licence, identity) as a 17-year-old requires consideration of parental consent and age-appropriate data handling (GDPR-001).             |
| **GDPR**   | Data minimization — only personal data strictly necessary for underwriting the additional driver may be collected and retained (GDPR-004).                                         |
| **FSA**    | Premium transparency — Henrik must receive a clear explanation of how adding a young driver affects pricing before the change is confirmed (FSA-004).                              |
| **FSA**    | Trafikförsäkring covers all authorized drivers of the vehicle, not only the policyholder; Wilma is covered by the mandatory liability component as soon as she is added (FSA-007). |
| **IDD**    | Adding a named driver materially changes the policy's risk profile and triggers a demands-and-needs reassessment to ensure coverage remains suitable (IDD-001).                    |
