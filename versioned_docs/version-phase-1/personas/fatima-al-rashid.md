## Insurance Situation

| Field            | Details                                                           |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Current coverage | Fleet policy covering 8 service vans                              |
| Vehicles         | 8 × Volkswagen Caddy vans (2018–2023 models)                      |
| Bonus class      | Fleet-level bonus; varies per vehicle based on claims history     |
| Drivers          | 12 employees authorized to drive; drivers rotate between vehicles |
| Coverage goal    | Commercial helförsäkring with liability coverage for business use |

## Goals

- Add or remove vehicles from the fleet without lengthy administrative processes
- Track which employees are authorized drivers and update the list easily
- Get a clear fleet-level overview: total premium, claims history per vehicle,
  upcoming renewals
- File claims quickly when an employee reports a vehicle incident
- Understand how a claim on one vehicle affects the fleet's overall premium

## Frustrations / Pain Points

- **Administrative burden** — adding a new van or a new employee as a driver
  requires multiple phone calls and forms; no self-service fleet management
- **Driver tracking** — no clear view of which employee is assigned to which
  vehicle; when a claim occurs, determining the responsible driver is manual
- **Employee claims** — when an employee has an accident, the claims process is
  confusing regarding liability (business vs. personal)
- **Lack of fleet reporting** — no consolidated dashboard showing claims
  frequency, cost per vehicle, or fleet-wide bonus status
- **Multiple contacts** — different departments handle fleet policy changes vs.
  claims, and they don't always share context

## Tech Comfort Level

**Medium.** Fatima uses a tablet and smartphone for day-to-day business
management. She is comfortable with digital tools but prefers straightforward
interfaces over complex dashboards. For complex fleet changes, she expects to
speak to a dedicated business account manager. She authenticates with BankID for
both personal and business matters.

## Regulatory Touchpoints

| Regulation | Relevance                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **GDPR**   | Fatima processes employee personal data (names, driving licenses, employment details) as a data controller; employee consent or legitimate interest is required (GDPR-001). |
| **GDPR**   | Employee driver data shared with TryggFörsäkring requires a data processing agreement and transparent privacy information (GDPR-001, GDPR-004).                             |
| **IDD**    | Demands-and-needs assessment (IDD-001) requirements may differ for commercial customers; Fatima's fleet needs must be documented.                                           |
| **FSA**    | Every van in the fleet must have valid trafikförsäkring (FSA-007); adding a new vehicle must trigger immediate coverage.                                                    |
| **FSA**    | Commercial fleet policies are subject to product oversight and governance (FSA-005).                                                                                        |
