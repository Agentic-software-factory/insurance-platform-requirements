# David Lindgren, 30 — Leasingkund (Leasing Customer)

## Avatar Description

A man around thirty in a slim-fit jacket and sneakers, standing in an underground
parking garage next to a white 2024 Volkswagen ID.4. He is leaning against the
car with his laptop bag slung over one shoulder, scrolling through his phone with
a slightly puzzled expression as he compares insurance quotes.

## Insurance Situation

| Field            | Details                                                                                                            |

| Current coverage | Helförsäkring (mandated by leasing agreement)                                                                      |
| Vehicle          | 2024 Volkswagen ID.4 Pro (privatleasing via Volkswagen Financial Services, 36-month contract)                      |
| Bonus class      | 3 (six years driving, started late at age 24)                                                                      |
| Situation        | Leasing agreement requires helförsäkring with a maximum 3,000 SEK deductible and the leasing company as intressent |
| Coverage goal    | Find the best price within the constraints imposed by the leasing agreement                                        |

## Goals

- Shop for the most competitive helförsäkring premium while staying within the
  leasing company's mandatory coverage and deductible requirements
- Understand the three-party relationship between himself, TryggFörsäkring, and
  Volkswagen Financial Services — specifically who is responsible for what during
  a claim
- Clarify whether he needs separate gap insurance to cover the difference between
  the car's market value and the remaining lease balance if the vehicle is
  totalled
- Ensure the policy correctly names Volkswagen Financial Services as interested
  party (intressent) so the leasing agreement remains valid
- Know what happens at end-of-lease — whether excess wear and minor damage are
  covered by his insurance or if that is his personal liability

## Frustrations / Pain Points

- **Three-party confusion** — David does not understand the division of
  responsibility between himself, TryggFörsäkring, and the leasing company when
  a claim occurs; each party seems to point to the other
- **Constrained choice** — the leasing agreement dictates minimum coverage and
  maximum deductible, limiting his ability to reduce costs through lower coverage
  or higher self-risk
- **Gap insurance uncertainty** — no one has clearly explained whether his
  helförsäkring covers the gap between market value and remaining lease balance
  in a total-loss scenario, or whether he needs a separate policy
- **Interested-party complexity** — adding the leasing company as intressent on
  the policy is an unfamiliar concept and David worries about getting it wrong
  and voiding his leasing contract
- **End-of-lease liability** — David is unsure whether minor paint scratches,
  kerb rash on wheels, or interior wear at lease return are insurable events or
  purely his financial responsibility

## Tech Comfort Level

**High.** David is a UX designer who evaluates digital products for a living. He
expects a fully digital self-service experience — online quotes, BankID signing,
real-time policy documents, and app-based claims filing. He has little patience
for phone calls, paper forms, or having to visit a physical office. If the
digital experience is poor, he will switch insurer without hesitation.

## Regulatory Touchpoints

| Regulation | Relevance                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **FSA**    | Trafikförsäkring is the registered keeper's responsibility even for leased vehicles; David as the registered user must ensure valid coverage is in place (FSA-007).                         |
| **FSA**    | Premium and coverage transparency — David must be able to understand what the mandated helförsäkring includes and how his premium is calculated within the leasing constraints (FSA-004).   |
| **IDD**    | The demands-and-needs assessment must account for leasing-specific constraints such as mandated coverage levels and deductible caps when recommending a product (IDD-001).                  |
| **IDD**    | The Insurance Product Information Document (IPID) must clearly describe whether gap coverage is included or excluded, so David can make an informed decision (IDD-002).                     |
| **GDPR**   | Data sharing between TryggFörsäkring and Volkswagen Financial Services — transferring policy details to the leasing company requires a lawful basis and transparent information (GDPR-001). |
| **GDPR**   | Data minimization — only the personal data strictly necessary for the leasing company's interested-party role may be shared; no broader profiling or marketing use is permitted (GDPR-004). |
