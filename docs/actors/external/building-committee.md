# Building Committee (Byggnadsnämnd)

- **Swedish term:** Byggnadsnämnd
- **English name:** Municipal Building Committee
- **Description:** The municipal authority responsible for building permits,
  building code compliance, and oversight of construction activities. The
  building committee enforces Boverkets Byggregler (BBR) and Plan- och
  Bygglagen (PBL). In the insurance context, building committee records are
  relevant for verifying that insured properties comply with building codes,
  assessing renovation permits, and investigating claims where non-compliant
  construction may be a contributing factor.
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Issue building permits (bygglov) for renovations and new construction
  - Enforce building code compliance (BBR)
  - Provide building permit records for underwriting and claims assessment
  - Issue completion certificates (slutbesked) confirming code compliance
  - Investigate unauthorized construction that may affect claims
- **Key interactions:** Underwriting (building permit verification, code
  compliance assessment), claims handling (investigation of non-compliant
  construction as a contributing factor to damage)
- **Regulatory relevance:**
  - FSA — building code compliance data supports accurate risk assessment and
    fair claims settlement (FSA-005, FSA-010)
  - GDPR — building permit records may include property owner personal data;
    access must follow purpose limitation (GDPR-001)
