  surveying, property registration, and geographic information. Lantmäteriet
  maintains the property register (fastighetsregistret) containing property

  - Provide building data (construction year, area, building type)

    landslide risk areas)

  data for risk assessment, geographic risk data), claims handling (verifying
  insurable interest, property details)

  - FSA — property data supports accurate risk assessment and product oversight
    (FSA-005)
  - GDPR — property register data includes personal data (owner names);
    access must have a legal basis and follow purpose limitation (GDPR-001)
