# Fire Department (Räddningstjänsten)

- **Swedish term:** Räddningstjänsten
- **English name:** Municipal Rescue Service / Fire Department
- **Description:** The municipal rescue service responsible for emergency
  response to fires, floods, and other hazardous events affecting insured
  properties. Fire department incident reports (insatsrapporter) are critical
  evidence in home & property claims, providing details on cause of fire, extent
  of damage, and actions taken. The fire department also performs fire cause
  investigations that inform liability determination.
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Respond to fire, flood, and other property emergencies
  - Produce incident reports documenting cause, extent, and response actions
  - Perform fire cause investigations
  - Provide incident reports to insurers upon request for claims processing
  - Issue fire safety compliance reports
- **Key interactions:** Claims handling (incident reports for fire and flood
  claims, cause of loss determination), fraud detection (fire cause
  investigation supporting arson detection)
- **Regulatory relevance:**
  - FSA — incident reports support evidence-based and fair claims settlement
    (FSA-010)
  - GDPR — exchange of personal data between rescue services and insurer must
    have a legal basis; data minimization applies (GDPR-001)
