# BRF Board (BRF-styrelse)

- **Swedish term:** BRF-styrelse
- **English name:** Tenant-Owner Association Board
- **Description:** The board of a bostadsrättsförening (tenant-owner association)
  responsible for managing building insurance, approving renovations, and
  coordinating shared claims for multi-unit residential properties. BRF boards
  are key stakeholders in home & property insurance as they hold the building
  insurance policy on behalf of all members while individual members insure
  their own apartments through separate bostadsrättstillägg coverage.
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Hold and manage the building insurance policy (fastighetsförsäkring) for
    the association
  - Report building-level claims (e.g., roof damage, pipe bursts in shared
    areas)
  - Approve and coordinate renovations that may affect insurance coverage
  - Provide building documentation for underwriting and claims assessment
  - Coordinate with individual member claims when damage spans shared and
    private areas
  - Maintain building safety and maintenance records
- **Key interactions:** Claims handling (building-level claims, shared/private
  damage coordination), underwriting (building risk assessment, renovation
  approvals), policy administration (building policy management)
- **Regulatory relevance:**
  - FSA — building insurance must meet consumer protection standards; BRF
    members are protected as policyholders (FSA-004)
  - GDPR — BRF board shares member data (names, apartment numbers) with
    insurer for claims coordination; requires legal basis and data processing
    agreement (GDPR-001)
  - IDD — BRF boards purchasing building insurance are entitled to
    demands-and-needs assessment and product information (IDD-001, IDD-002)
