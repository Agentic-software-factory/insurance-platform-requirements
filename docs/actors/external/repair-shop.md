# Repair Shop (Verkstad)

- **Swedish term:** Verkstad
- **English name:** Authorized Repair Shop
- **Description:** Vehicle repair facilities authorized by TryggFörsäkring to
  perform repairs on insured vehicles. Authorized repair shops have agreements
  with the insurer covering repair quality standards, pricing, and direct
  billing. Customers may also choose non-authorized shops, but the claims
  process differs.
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Receive repair assignments from TryggFörsäkring
  - Provide repair cost estimates for claims assessment
  - Perform vehicle repairs according to agreed quality standards
  - Submit invoices directly to TryggFörsäkring (direct settlement)
  - Report repair completion and return vehicle to customer
- **Key interactions:** Claims handling (repair assignment, cost estimation,
  invoicing), claims adjustment (coordinated assessments)
- **Regulatory relevance:**
  - FSA — repair quality and cost management support fair claims settlement
    obligations (FSA-010)
  - GDPR — receives limited personal data (vehicle owner, contact details)
    necessary for repair coordination; subject to data processing agreements
    (GDPR-001)
