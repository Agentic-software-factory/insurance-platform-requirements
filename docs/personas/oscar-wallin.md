# Oscar Wallin, 26 — Gig Economy Driver (Gig-ekonomi)

## Avatar Description

A young man in his mid-twenties wearing a dark hoodie and wireless earbuds,
sitting in the driver's seat of a white 2018 Volkswagen Golf. His phone is
mounted on the dashboard showing the Bolt driver app with an incoming ride
request. A camera bag is visible on the back seat. He looks alert but slightly
anxious, glancing between the app and the road ahead.

## Insurance Situation

| Current coverage | Trafikförsäkring + halvförsäkring on a 2018 Volkswagen Golf (declared as personal use only)                         |
| Vehicle          | 2018 Volkswagen Golf                                                                                                |

| Disclosure gap   | Drives for Bolt 15-20 hours/week but has not disclosed commercial use to TryggFörsäkring — coverage may be voidable |

## Goals

- Understand whether his current halvförsäkring covers him while driving for
  Bolt, and what exactly happens if he files a claim during a commercial ride
- Get a clear, upfront answer on how much his premium would increase if he
  discloses the Bolt driving — so he can make an informed decision rather than
  hiding it
- Learn how Bolt's own platform insurance interacts with his personal policy —
  whether there are gaps, overlaps, or coordination-of-benefits rules
- Find a coverage tier or add-on specifically designed for gig economy drivers
  that is affordable on a variable income
- Protect his bonus class and claims record — he has been claim-free for three
  years and does not want to lose that progress by switching to a commercial
  policy

## Frustrations / Pain Points

- **Disclosure fear** — Oscar knows he should report the Bolt driving but is
  afraid the premium increase will be unaffordable on his variable income; the
  longer he waits, the worse the consequences of non-disclosure become
- **Regulatory gray zone** — Swedish insurance law has not fully caught up with
  the gig economy; Oscar cannot find clear guidance on whether part-time
  ride-hailing counts as "commercial use" requiring yrkestrafiktillstånd
- **Platform insurance confusion** — Bolt claims to provide insurance for
  drivers during active rides, but the policy details are buried in terms and
  conditions written for a different jurisdiction; Oscar does not know what is
  actually covered in Sweden
- **No tailored product** — TryggFörsäkring offers personal and commercial
  motor insurance, but nothing in between; Oscar's 15-20 hours/week of
  ride-hailing does not fit neatly into either category
- **Claims denial risk** — if Oscar is involved in an accident while carrying a
  Bolt passenger and TryggFörsäkring discovers the undisclosed commercial use,
  the entire claim could be denied — leaving him personally liable for damages

## Tech Comfort Level

**High.** Oscar is a digital native who manages his entire work life through
apps — Bolt driver app, photography booking platforms, mobile banking, and social
media for marketing his freelance work. He expects fully digital self-service for
insurance: online quotes, instant policy changes, and real-time claim tracking.
He would find it unacceptable to have to call during office hours or visit a
physical branch. He is comfortable with telematics or usage-based insurance if it
means a fairer price.

## Regulatory Touchpoints

| Regulation | Relevance                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **FSA**    | Trafikförsäkring covers third-party liability regardless of personal or commercial use, but comprehensive (halvförsäkring/helförsäkring) coverage may exclude undisclosed commercial use (FSA-007).  |
| **FSA**    | Consumer protection requires fair treatment; however, the insurer has the right to decline or reduce claims when the policyholder has failed to disclose material information (FSA-004, FSA-010).    |
| **IDD**    | The demands-and-needs assessment must explicitly ask about vehicle usage, including ride-hailing and delivery — the platform should prompt for commercial use at quote and renewal (IDD-001).        |
| **IDD**    | Pre-contractual information (IPID) must clearly state any exclusions related to commercial or gig economy use so the customer can make an informed decision (IDD-003).                               |
| **GDPR**   | If telematics or usage-based tracking is required to distinguish personal from commercial driving, transparent data processing with explicit consent and purpose limitation is mandatory (GDPR-001). |
