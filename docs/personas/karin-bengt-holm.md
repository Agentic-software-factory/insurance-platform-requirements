# Karin & Bengt Holm, 57/59 — Fritidshusägare (Vacation Home Owners)

> _"The house sits empty from October to April. Every winter I worry about
> frozen pipes and break-ins, and I can never reach anyone at the insurance
> company on a Sunday."_

## Avatar Description

A couple in their late fifties standing on the porch of a traditional red-
painted Swedish stuga by a lake in Dalarna. The house is surrounded by birch
trees, and there is a woodpile stacked neatly beside the entrance. Snow covers
the ground, suggesting the off-season.

## Insurance Situation

| Field            | Details                                                                             |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Current coverage | Villahemförsäkring on primary home; basic fritidshusförsäkring on vacation home     |
| Property         | 1940s timber fritidshus (85 m²), partially renovated, no central heating            |
| Coverage goal    | Enhanced fritidshusförsäkring covering frost damage, storm, burglary, and liability |
| Key concern      | Property is unoccupied 6+ months per year, increasing risk of undetected damage     |
| Additional needs | Coverage for outbuildings (gäststuga, förråd), boat, and garden equipment           |

## Goals

- Get comprehensive coverage for a property that is unoccupied most of the year
  without paying an unreasonable premium
- Understand what obligations they have as property owners to prevent damage
  (e.g., winterizing pipes, draining water systems) and how non-compliance
  affects claims
- Receive prompt claims handling even for a remote property — they cannot easily
  visit mid-winter
- Have a single point of contact who understands their combined primary home and
  vacation home insurance needs

## Frustrations / Pain Points

- **Unoccupied property surcharges** — premiums are higher because the property
  is vacant most of the year, but alternatives are limited
- **Prevention requirements** — unclear exactly what preventive measures the
  insurer requires (e.g., must pipes be drained? must water be shut off?) and
  what happens to a claim if requirements are not met
- **Remote damage detection** — by the time frost damage or a break-in is
  discovered, weeks may have passed, complicating claims
- **Limited digital comfort** — prefer phone or in-person contact, but the
  insurer's phone lines have long wait times and no local office exists anymore

## Tech Comfort Level

**Low-medium.** Karin and Bengt use smartphones for basic tasks (calls, SMS,
photos, BankID) and can navigate a simple website, but they are not comfortable
with complex digital self-service tools. They prefer to call and speak with a
person, especially for claims. Bengt can handle email correspondence and basic
online forms. They do not use insurance apps and would not file a claim through
one.

## Regulatory Touchpoints

| Regulation | Relevance                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **IDD**    | A demands-and-needs assessment (IDD-001) must account for the specific risks of an unoccupied seasonal property.                                                |
| **IDD**    | The IPID (IDD-002) must clearly state coverage exclusions related to unoccupied properties and prevention obligations.                                          |
| **IDD**    | Pre-contractual information (IDD-003) must explain seasonal property limitations transparently.                                                                 |
| **FSA**    | Claims settlement must be fair and timely regardless of property location or season (FSA-010).                                                                  |
| **FSA**    | Premium calculations must transparently reflect the risk factors associated with unoccupied properties (FSA-004).                                               |
| **GDPR**   | Processing property data for two locations and any IoT sensor data (if installed for monitoring) requires lawful basis and transparent privacy info (GDPR-001). |
