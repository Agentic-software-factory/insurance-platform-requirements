## Avatar Description

A young woman in her late twenties wearing a winter jacket, standing next to a
white Tesla Model 3 at a charging station in a snowy parking lot. She is
checking the charging app on her phone while glancing at the wallbox display,
breath visible in the cold northern Swedish air.

| Location   | Umeå, Sweden (Norrland)                  |

## Insurance Situation

| Field            | Details                                                                                |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Current coverage | Helförsäkring (required by financing agreement with Santander)                         |
| Vehicle          | 2024 Tesla Model 3 Long Range (purchased new, financed)                                |
| Bonus class      | 2 (four years driving, no claims)                                                      |
| Coverage goal    | Understand what her helförsäkring actually covers for EV-specific components and risks |

## Goals

- Confirm that her policy covers battery damage and degradation — the battery
  is the most expensive single component and she wants explicit clarity on what
  scenarios are included
- Understand whether her home wallbox (charging station) and charging cable are
  covered under her motor policy or require separate home insurance
- Get transparency on what drives her premium — she suspects the high vehicle
  value is the main factor and wants to know if there are ways to reduce cost
- Find out which repair shops in Norrland are authorized to work on EVs, since
  high-voltage vehicle repairs require specialist certification
- Ensure she has adequate roadside assistance that understands EV-specific
  issues such as flatbed towing requirements (EVs should not be towed on driven
  wheels)

## Frustrations / Pain Points

- **Battery coverage ambiguity** — her policy documents do not clearly state
  whether battery degradation, thermal runaway, or charging-related damage are
  covered; she has to call customer service to get vague answers
- **Premium sticker shock** — as a 28-year-old with a high-value new vehicle,
  her premium is significantly higher than colleagues with comparable ICE cars,
  and she does not understand the breakdown
- **Limited EV repair network** — very few workshops in northern Sweden have
  the high-voltage certification required for EV repairs, which could mean long
  wait times or transporting the car hundreds of kilometres
- **Winter range anxiety and insurance implications** — she worries about
  getting stranded in extreme cold when battery range drops, and whether
  roadside assistance covers EV-specific recovery
- **Telematics uncertainty** — her Tesla collects extensive driving data; she is
  unsure whether TryggFörsäkring uses or could request this data and what that
  means for her privacy

## Tech Comfort Level

**High.** Lina is a digital native who manages most of her life through apps.
She monitors her Tesla through the manufacturer's app, uses BankID for all
banking and government services, and expects to manage her insurance policy
entirely online. She would prefer a chat or in-app support channel over calling
a phone number.

## Regulatory Touchpoints

| Regulation | Relevance                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **FSA**    | Trafikförsäkring is mandatory regardless of propulsion type; EV owners have the same obligation as ICE vehicle owners (FSA-007).                                                  |
| **FSA**    | Premium transparency — Lina must be able to understand the factors driving her premium, including any EV-specific rating factors (FSA-004).                                       |
| **IDD**    | Demands-and-needs assessment must consider EV-specific coverage needs such as battery protection, charging equipment, and specialist repair requirements (IDD-001).               |
| **IDD**    | The Insurance Product Information Document (IPID) must clearly state whether battery damage, charging infrastructure, and EV-specific roadside assistance are included (IDD-002). |
| **GDPR**   | Vehicle telematics data collected by the manufacturer or insurer constitutes personal data; processing requires explicit consent and transparent information (GDPR-001).          |

  workshops with high-voltage certification are critical for Lina's claims
  experience.
