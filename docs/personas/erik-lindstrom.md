| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Age        | 19                                                    |
| Location   | Örebro, Sweden                                        |
| Occupation | University student (part-time job at a grocery store) |
| Income     | Low — dependent on study grants and part-time wages   |

## Insurance Situation

| Field            | Details                                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Current coverage | None — first-time buyer                                      |
| Vehicle          | Used 2016 Volvo V40 (purchased from a relative)              |
| Bonus class      | 0 (no claims history, starting at the lowest discount level) |
| Coverage goal    | Trafikförsäkring (mandatory minimum) or halvförsäkring       |

## Goals

- Get legally insured as quickly and cheaply as possible
- Understand the difference between trafikförsäkring, halvförsäkring, and
  helförsäkring without insurance jargon
- Complete the entire purchase process on his phone
- Build up a bonus class over time to lower premiums

## Frustrations / Pain Points

- **High premiums** — young drivers in bonus class 0 pay the highest rates,
  which feels unfair when he has no claims history at all
- **Confusing terminology** — Swedish insurance terms are difficult to parse
  without prior experience
- **Lack of transparency** — unclear why the premium is so high or what factors
  drive pricing
- **Desktop-oriented flows** — if the quote-and-bind process requires a desktop
  browser, he may abandon it

## Tech Comfort Level

**High (digital native).** Erik does everything on his smartphone. He expects a
mobile-first experience with instant feedback, minimal form fields, and the
ability to authenticate with BankID via the mobile app. He has no interest in
calling a phone line or visiting a physical office.

## Regulatory Touchpoints

| **IDD**    | Pre-contractual information must be clear and not misleading (IDD-003), especially important for a first-time buyer.                           |
| **FSA**    | Trafikförsäkring is mandatory for every registered vehicle (FSA-007); Erik must be insured before driving on public roads.                     |
