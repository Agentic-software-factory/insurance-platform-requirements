# Niklas Bergman, 35 — Claims Reporter (Skadeanmälare)

> _"I've never filed a claim before. I just want to know what happens next and
> when I can get my car back — I need it for work."_

## Avatar Description

A man in his mid-thirties wearing a work jacket with an electrician's tool belt,
standing next to a damaged dark grey Skoda Octavia at a roundabout. He is holding
his phone in one hand and rubbing his neck with the other, looking stressed and
uncertain.

| Current coverage | Halvförsäkring on a 2020 Skoda Octavia Combi (work and family use)                                      |
| Vehicle          | 2020 Skoda Octavia Combi                                                                                |

| Claim situation  | Rear-ended at a roundabout; not at fault. Minor whiplash, significant vehicle damage. First claim ever. |

## Goals

- Get his vehicle repaired or replaced as quickly as possible so he can continue
  working — every day without a car means lost income
- Understand the full claims process from start to finish, including timelines
  and what he needs to provide
- Confirm that his bonus class will not drop since the accident was not his fault
- Secure a rental car or replacement vehicle while his Skoda is being repaired
- Ensure his whiplash injury is properly documented and any medical costs are
  covered through the at-fault driver's trafikförsäkring

## Frustrations / Pain Points

- **First-time anxiety** — Niklas has never filed a claim and does not know what
  to expect; he worries about making mistakes that could delay or reduce his
  settlement
- **Work dependency on the car** — as a self-employed electrician, he drives to
  customer sites daily; being without a car directly impacts his livelihood
- **Liability confusion** — he was clearly not at fault but does not understand
  how liability determination and subrogation between insurers work
- **Medical documentation complexity** — the whiplash injury requires medical
  records, and he is unsure what documentation the insurer needs and how
  sensitive health data will be handled
- **Bonus class worry** — despite not causing the accident, he fears his bonus
  class will be affected, increasing future premiums

## Tech Comfort Level

**Medium-high.** Niklas uses his smartphone daily for work scheduling, invoicing
(via an accounting app), and communication. He prefers handling administrative
tasks on his phone when possible but is comfortable using a laptop for more
complex forms. He expects to be able to file his claim digitally, upload photos
of the damage, and track the progress online. He would find it frustrating to
have to call or visit an office during working hours.

## Regulatory Touchpoints

| Regulation | Relevance                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **FSA**    | Niklas's claim must be settled fairly and within a reasonable timeframe in accordance with FSA consumer protection requirements (FSA-010).                                |
| **FSA**    | If Niklas disagrees with the claims decision, he must be informed of the complaints procedure and his right to escalate (FSA-011).                                        |
| **GDPR**   | Niklas's whiplash medical records constitute special-category personal data; processing requires explicit purpose limitation and data minimization (GDPR-001).            |
| **GDPR**   | Medical data collected for the claim must not be used for other purposes such as underwriting future policies without separate lawful basis (GDPR-004).                   |
| **IDD**    | The quality of claims handling — including timeliness, communication, and fairness — is part of TryggFörsäkring's product oversight and governance obligations (IDD-004). |
