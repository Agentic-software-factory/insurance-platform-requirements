# Personas

Personas bring actors to life with realistic profiles that help development teams
understand user needs, motivations, and pain points. They are referenced
throughout user stories to provide empathy and context for design and
implementation decisions.

Each persona represents a key customer segment or internal user role within the
motor insurance domain. Together they cover the range of interactions that the
TryggFörsäkring platform must support.

## How Personas Are Used

- **User stories** reference personas by name to ground requirements in real
  user context (e.g., _"As Erik, I want to compare trafikförsäkring and
  halvförsäkring so I can choose the cheapest option that meets my needs."_)
- **Acceptance criteria** consider each persona's tech comfort level and
  communication preferences.
- **Regulatory touchpoints** listed on each persona page highlight which
  regulations are most relevant to that user segment.
