# Karin Ström, 45 — Frånskild, ägarövergång (Divorce, Vehicle Transfer)

> _"I drove that car claim-free for twelve years, but because the policy was in
> my ex-husband's name I have to start from scratch — how is that fair?"_

## Avatar Description

A woman in her mid-forties in a practical autumn jacket, standing outside a
Transportstyrelsen service point holding a folder of divorce-settlement
documents. A silver 2021 Volvo XC40 is parked behind her. She looks tired but
determined, checking her phone for insurance quotes between glances at the
paperwork.

| Current coverage | None in her own name — previously covered as a named driver on her ex-husband's helförsäkring                                                                                  |
| Vehicle          | 2021 Volvo XC40 (being transferred to Karin as part of bodelning)                                                                                                              |
| Bonus class      | 0 (no personal bonus class — twelve years of claim-free driving as a named driver on her ex-husband's policy are not automatically recognised)                                 |
| Situation        | Ownership transfer is in progress at Transportstyrelsen; Karin must arrange her own policy before the transfer completes to avoid a gap in mandatory trafikförsäkring coverage |
| Coverage goal    | Helförsäkring at a manageable premium despite starting at bonus class 0, with no coverage gap during the ownership transition                                                  |

## Goals

- Secure her own helförsäkring policy on the Volvo XC40 before the
  Transportstyrelsen ownership transfer completes, ensuring continuous
  trafikförsäkring coverage with no gap
- Obtain recognition for her twelve years of claim-free driving as a named
  driver so she does not have to start at the lowest bonus class
- Understand the exact timeline coordination between the ownership transfer at
  Transportstyrelsen and her new policy start date
- Keep the premium affordable on a single income, exploring any available
  discounts or bonus class transfer mechanisms
- Have her personal data cleanly separated from her ex-husband's policy records
  so neither party has access to the other's insurance information

## Frustrations / Pain Points

- **Bonus class injustice** — twelve years of claim-free driving count for
  nothing because the policies were registered in her ex-husband's name; Karin
  feels punished for a common marital arrangement
- **Coverage gap risk** — coordinating the exact handover date between her
  ex-husband's policy ending and her new policy starting is stressful, and a
  gap would violate trafikförsäkring law
- **Bureaucratic complexity** — managing simultaneous processes at
  Transportstyrelsen, the insurance company, and the divorce settlement feels
  overwhelming during an already difficult life event
- **Premium shock** — starting at bonus class 0 means significantly higher
  premiums than she is used to, adding financial strain to an already tight
  single-income budget
- **Data privacy concerns** — Karin wants assurance that her ex-husband cannot
  see or access her new policy details, and that her personal data has been
  fully separated from his account

## Tech Comfort Level

**Medium.** Karin is comfortable with everyday digital services and uses BankID
regularly. She prefers handling straightforward tasks online but wants to speak
with an insurance agent for complex matters like bonus class transfers and
coverage timing during the ownership transition. She does not want to manage the
entire process through a self-service portal alone — the stakes feel too high
for a purely digital experience.

## Regulatory Touchpoints

| Regulation | Relevance                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **FSA**    | Continuous trafikförsäkring is mandatory — no gap is permitted during the ownership transfer from ex-husband to Karin; the platform must support seamless policy transition (FSA-007).               |
| **FSA**    | TFF bonus class rules govern whether named-driver history can be recognised when establishing a new policyholder's bonus class; the platform must support bonus class transfer assessment (FSA-008). |
| **FSA**    | Consumer protection requires fair treatment during life events — Karin must not be disadvantaged by standard marital insurance arrangements when establishing her own policy (FSA-004).              |
| **IDD**    | A demands-and-needs assessment must be performed for Karin as a new policyholder, considering her specific situation including the ownership transfer timeline and premium sensitivity (IDD-001).    |
| **GDPR**   | Personal data separation — Karin's data must be fully separated from her ex-husband's policy records, ensuring neither party can access the other's insurance information (GDPR-001).                |
| **GDPR**   | Right to data portability — if Karin's driving history is held under her ex-husband's policy, she may request extraction of her own data to support a bonus class transfer application (GDPR-003).   |
