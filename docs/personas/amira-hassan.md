## Avatar Description

A woman in her early thirties in a bright rental apartment in Malmö. The
apartment is lively with children's toys and family photos. She is sitting at
the kitchen table with a laptop open to an insurance website, looking
thoughtful. Two children are playing in the background.

## Insurance Situation

| Field            | Details                                                                        |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Current coverage | No hemförsäkring — uninsured since arriving in Sweden                          |
| Property         | Rental apartment — building insurance is the landlord's responsibility         |
| Coverage goal    | Hemförsäkring covering contents, personal liability, and legal protection      |
| Key concern      | Affordability — must cover a large family's belongings on a limited budget     |
| Additional needs | Reseskydd (travel insurance) for family visits abroad; child accident coverage |

## Goals

- Get hemförsäkring that covers the family's belongings and provides liability
  protection at a price she can afford
- Understand what hemförsäkring actually covers in plain, clear language —
  preferably with explanations available in Arabic
- Complete the purchase process without needing to understand complex Swedish
  insurance terminology
- Know exactly what to do and who to call if something happens (fire, theft,
  water damage)

## Frustrations / Pain Points

- **Language barrier** — insurance terminology is difficult even for native
  Swedish speakers; for Amira, terms like "allrisk," "självrisk," and
  "ansvarsförsäkring" are nearly impenetrable
- **Unfamiliarity with Swedish insurance system** — in her home country,
  insurance worked differently; she does not know what is expected or mandatory
  in Sweden
- **Price sensitivity** — every hundred kronor matters in the family budget;
  she needs to understand exactly what she is paying for
- **Trust concerns** — unsure whether an insurer will treat her claim fairly;
  has heard stories of claims being denied

## Tech Comfort Level

**Medium.** Amira uses her smartphone daily for communication, banking (with
BankID), and social media. She can navigate websites and fill in online forms
but is slowed by complex Swedish text. She prefers visual guides and step-by-
step instructions over long text blocks. She would appreciate a phone option
with multilingual support for complex questions.

## Regulatory Touchpoints

| Regulation | Relevance                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **IDD**    | A demands-and-needs assessment (IDD-001) must consider Amira's family size, budget constraints, and specific coverage needs.                          |
| **IDD**    | Pre-contractual information (IDD-003) must be understandable; accessibility and plain language are especially important for non-native speakers.      |
| **IDD**    | The IPID (IDD-002) must be provided in a clear format so Amira can compare hemförsäkring options.                                                     |
| **FSA**    | Amira has a 14-day cooling-off period for distance-sold policies (FSA-013).                                                                           |
| **FSA**    | Fair treatment of customers regardless of background or language proficiency is a core FSA consumer protection principle (FSA-011).                   |
| **GDPR**   | Processing personal data for Amira and her family members (including children) requires lawful basis and appropriate safeguards (GDPR-001).           |
| **GDPR**   | Privacy information must be accessible and understandable; providing it only in complex Swedish may not meet the transparency requirement (GDPR-001). |
