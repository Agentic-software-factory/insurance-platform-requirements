# Anna & Marcus Johansson, 38/40 — Family with Multiple Vehicles

> _"We just want one place to see both cars, both policies, and know that
> everything is sorted. We don't have time to manage insurance separately."_

## Avatar Description

A couple in their late thirties, standing in front of a suburban house with a
driveway containing two cars: a larger family SUV and a smaller commuter
hatchback. They look busy but organized.

## Insurance Situation

| Field            | Details                                                                                     |

| Current coverage | Two active policies with TryggFörsäkring                                                    |
| Vehicle 1        | 2022 Volkswagen ID.4 (family SUV) — helförsäkring                                           |
| Vehicle 2        | 2017 Toyota Yaris (commuter) — halvförsäkring                                               |
| Bonus class      | Anna: class 6 (12 years claim-free); Marcus: class 5 (10 years claim-free)                  |
| Coverage goal    | Keep helförsäkring on the newer car; evaluate if halvförsäkring is enough for the older car |

## Goals

- Manage both policies from a single household view — one login, one overview
- Easily compare coverage levels and adjust if circumstances change (e.g., new
  car, teenager starts driving)
- Receive a single consolidated invoice or coordinated payment schedule
- Retain their high bonus class and understand how a claim on one car affects
  the other

## Frustrations / Pain Points

- **Fragmented experience** — each policy is managed independently with no
  household concept; updating an address requires doing it twice
- **Bonus class confusion** — unclear whether Marcus's bonus class is affected
  if Anna has an accident in the shared vehicle
- **Coverage comparison difficulty** — hard to see at a glance what each policy
  covers and where the gaps are
- **Renewal timing** — the two policies renew on different dates, making it easy
  to miss a renewal or overlook a price increase

## Tech Comfort Level

**Medium-high.** Both Anna and Marcus are comfortable with digital services.
They prefer self-service via a web portal or app but will call customer service
for complex questions (e.g., adding a teenage driver to a policy). They
authenticate with BankID and expect a responsive experience on both desktop and
mobile.

## Regulatory Touchpoints

| Regulation | Relevance                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **IDD**    | Each policy change or new purchase requires a demands-and-needs assessment (IDD-001); the family's combined situation should inform recommendations. |
| **IDD**    | IPIDs (IDD-002) must be provided for each coverage tier so Anna and Marcus can compare helförsäkring and halvförsäkring clearly.                     |
| **FSA**    | Both vehicles must have valid trafikförsäkring at all times (FSA-007).                                                                               |
| **FSA**    | Renewal terms and any premium changes must be communicated in advance (FSA-004).                                                                     |
| **GDPR**   | Both Anna and Marcus are data subjects; if they share a login or household view, consent and data access rights apply to each individual (GDPR-001). |
| **GDPR**   | Adding a teenage driver requires processing the child's personal data with appropriate legal basis (GDPR-001).                                       |
