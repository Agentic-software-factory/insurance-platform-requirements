# Gunnar Pettersson, 72 — Senior Renewing Long-Standing Policy

> _"I've been with the same company for over twenty years. I just want fair
> treatment and someone who explains things clearly — not a website."_

## Avatar Description

An older gentleman in a knitted sweater, sitting at a kitchen table with
paperwork spread out. A classic dark-green Saab 900 is visible through the
window. He looks thoughtful, reviewing an insurance renewal letter.

## Insurance Situation

| Field            | Details                                                                |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Current coverage | Helförsäkring (comprehensive) — has been with TryggFörsäkring 22 years |
| Vehicle          | 1993 Saab 900 Turbo (classic car, well-maintained, low mileage)        |
| Bonus class      | Maximum (class 7) — over 20 years without a claim                      |
| Annual mileage   | Approximately 5,000 km/year                                            |
| Coverage goal    | Maintain helförsäkring with agreed-value coverage for the classic car  |

## Goals

- Keep his policy without unexpected premium increases at renewal
- Receive clear, written communication about any changes to terms or pricing
- Speak to a knowledgeable person when he has questions — not navigate a chatbot
- Ensure his classic Saab is properly valued (agreed value, not market value)
- Understand what he is actually paying for, in plain language

## Frustrations / Pain Points

- **Automatic renewals with hidden increases** — premiums have increased year
  over year, but the renewal letter does not clearly highlight what changed or
  why
- **Digital-first bias** — the insurer pushes online self-service, but Gunnar
  prefers phone calls and physical mail; online portals feel confusing
- **Classic car valuation** — standard pricing models undervalue his
  well-maintained Saab; he worries about receiving market value instead of
  agreed value in a total loss
- **Loyalty not rewarded** — after 22 years as a customer, he feels he should
  receive better treatment, but there is no visible loyalty program or benefit
- **Fine print** — policy documents are long and filled with legal language that
  is hard to parse

## Tech Comfort Level

**Low.** Gunnar has a smartphone but uses it mainly for calls and SMS. He can
log in with BankID but finds web portals stressful. He strongly prefers
receiving paper letters and speaking to a human on the phone. If forced to use a
digital channel, he needs large text, simple navigation, and clear instructions.

## Regulatory Touchpoints

| Regulation | Relevance                                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **IDD**    | Renewal communications must include clear, non-misleading information about coverage and pricing changes (IDD-003).                                                 |
| **IDD**    | Even at renewal, a demands-and-needs assessment should confirm that Gunnar's coverage still matches his situation (IDD-001).                                        |
| **FSA**    | Consumer protection rules require fair treatment of long-standing customers; premium increases must be justified and communicated (FSA-004).                        |
| **FSA**    | Gunnar has a right to cancel and switch insurer; the process must not create unfair barriers (FSA-013).                                                             |
| **GDPR**   | Gunnar's long history with TryggFörsäkring means extensive personal data is stored; he has the right to access, correct, and request deletion (GDPR-001, GDPR-003). |
| **GDPR**   | Communication preference (paper mail) must be respected and recorded (GDPR-001).                                                                                    |
