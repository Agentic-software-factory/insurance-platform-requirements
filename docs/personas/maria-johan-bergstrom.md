# Maria & Johan Bergström, 34/36 — Villaägare (Homeowners)

## Avatar Description

A young couple standing in front of a newly purchased yellow wooden villa in
Nacka. They are carrying moving boxes and look excited but slightly
overwhelmed. A garden hose is coiled next to the house, and the lawn needs its
first mow.

## Insurance Situation

| Field            | Details                                                                    |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Current coverage | Previous bostadsrättsförsäkring (now cancelled); no villahemförsäkring yet |
| Property         | 1960s villa with original plumbing and updated electrical                  |
| Coverage goal    | Comprehensive villahemförsäkring: building + contents + liability          |
| Key concern      | Water damage protection — friends experienced costly vattenskada           |
| Additional needs | Allrisk/drulle for high-value electronics and child equipment              |

## Goals

- Understand the difference between building insurance (byggnadsförsäkring) and
  contents insurance (lösöresförsäkring) and why both are needed
- Get comprehensive coverage that protects against water damage, fire, storm,
  and liability without overpaying
- Manage the policy digitally but have access to phone support when filing a
  claim
- Receive clear guidance on what home improvements (e.g., bathroom renovation)
  require notifying the insurer

## Frustrations / Pain Points

- **First-time complexity** — transitioning from a simple BRF policy to a full
  villahemförsäkring is overwhelming; many new terms and coverage components
- **Water damage anxiety** — heard multiple stories of costly vattenskador in
  older houses and wants certainty about what is covered
- **Unclear rebuilding value** — unsure how to determine the correct
  återuppbyggnadskostnad (rebuilding cost) for the property
- **Bundling confusion** — want to know if bundling home and motor insurance
  saves money, but comparison is difficult across product lines

## Tech Comfort Level

**Medium-high.** Both Maria and Johan are comfortable with digital services and
prefer to research, compare, and purchase insurance online. Johan is especially
comfortable with self-service tools. However, for a major decision like home
insurance, they want the option to call and speak with a knowledgeable advisor.
They authenticate with BankID and expect a responsive experience on both
desktop and mobile.

| Regulation | Relevance                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| **IDD**    | An IPID (IDD-002) must be provided so Maria and Johan can compare coverage options for villahemförsäkring.                                                     |
| **IDD**    | Pre-contractual information (IDD-003) must clearly explain building vs contents coverage boundaries.                                                           |
| **FSA**    | Premium calculations and any risk surcharges (e.g., for older plumbing) must be transparently communicated (FSA-004).                                          |
| **FSA**    | Maria and Johan have a 14-day cooling-off period for distance-sold policies (FSA-013).                                                                         |
