## Avatar Description

A man in his early sixties in a meeting room in a BRF apartment building in
Göteborg. He is reviewing insurance documents at a table, with a folder of
building maintenance records beside him. Through the window, a typical Swedish
apartment block is visible. He looks serious and methodical.

## Insurance Situation

| Field            | Details                                                                              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Current coverage | BRF building insurance (fastighetsförsäkring) with a mid-tier insurer                |
| Property         | 1972 apartment block, 48 units, aging plumbing and flat roof                         |
| Coverage goal    | Comprehensive BRF fastighetsförsäkring with favorable vattenskada terms              |
| Key concern      | Repeated water damage claims from aging pipes; premium increases after each claim    |
| Additional needs | Board liability insurance (styrelseansvarsförsäkring), construction project coverage |

## Goals

- Secure the best possible building insurance for the BRF at a competitive
  premium, despite the building's claims history
- Understand exactly where BRF building insurance ends and individual
  bostadsrättsförsäkring begins — and communicate this clearly to residents
- Have a dedicated contact person at the insurance company who knows the
  building and its history
- Get support navigating the claims process for large-scale events (e.g., a
  pipe burst affecting multiple apartments)

## Frustrations / Pain Points

- **Premium escalation** — each vattenskada claim drives up the BRF's premium;
  Per-Erik needs to justify costs to frustrated members at the annual meeting
  (årsstämma)
- **Coverage boundary disputes** — when water from a shared pipe damages a
  member's apartment, it is unclear whether the BRF policy or the individual's
  bostadsrättstillägg should pay
- **Insurer turnover** — the BRF has switched insurers three times in five
  years chasing lower premiums, and each time they lose institutional knowledge
  about the building
- **Complex procurement** — comparing BRF insurance offers requires
  understanding technical terms and coverage differences that a volunteer board
  member is not trained for
- **Resident communication** — residents expect Per-Erik to explain insurance
  matters he is not qualified to advise on

## Tech Comfort Level

**Low-medium.** Per-Erik can use email, read PDFs, and navigate basic websites.
He is comfortable with BankID for authentication. However, he does not want to
manage a complex digital portal for the BRF's insurance. He prefers phone
contact and in-person meetings for important discussions. He prints documents
for board meetings rather than sharing them digitally.

## Regulatory Touchpoints

| Regulation | Relevance                                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **IDD**    | A demands-and-needs assessment (IDD-001) for a BRF must consider the building's age, construction type, claims history, and planned renovations.                     |
| **IDD**    | Pre-contractual information (IDD-003) must be clear enough for volunteer board members without insurance expertise to understand.                                    |
| **IDD**    | Product oversight (IDD-004) applies — the insurer must ensure BRF products are appropriate for the target market.                                                    |
| **FSA**    | Fair and timely claims settlement is critical when multiple residents are affected by a single event (FSA-010).                                                      |
| **FSA**    | Premium transparency (FSA-004) is especially important when Per-Erik must explain costs to BRF members.                                                              |
| **GDPR**   | Processing data about the BRF, its members, and claims history requires lawful basis; Per-Erik may need to share member data with the insurer for claims (GDPR-001). |
| **GDPR**   | If the insurer processes a member list or contact details provided by Per-Erik, data processing agreements must be in place (GDPR-004).                              |
