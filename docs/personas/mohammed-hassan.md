# Mohammed Hassan, 42 — Insurer Switcher (Bytare)

## Avatar Description

A man in his early forties wearing a casual blazer over a polo shirt, standing
outside a restaurant entrance. His 2021 Volvo XC60 is parked nearby. He is
holding a renewal letter in one hand and scrolling through insurance comparison
sites on his phone with the other, looking focused and slightly irritated.

## Insurance Situation

| Current coverage | Helförsäkring with If P&C on a 2021 Volvo XC60 (personal use)                                    |
| Vehicle          | 2021 Volvo XC60                                                                                  |
| Bonus class      | 6 (eight years claim-free)                                                                       |
| Switch trigger   | Received renewal quote with 15% premium increase; shopping for better pricing at TryggFörsäkring |

## Goals

- Transfer his bonus class 6 seamlessly from If to TryggFörsäkring via the
  TFF-managed bonus transfer process, ensuring no loss of earned discount
- Time the switch correctly — either at huvudförfallodag (main renewal date) or
  mid-term — without any gap in trafikförsäkring coverage
- Compare coverage tiers accurately between If and TryggFörsäkring, since
  helförsäkring terms differ between insurers despite the same name
- Bundle his personal Volvo XC60 insurance with fleet coverage for the two
  restaurant delivery vehicles, getting a cross-sell discount
- Receive a clear, written confirmation that his claims history is recognized
  and his bonus class is correctly registered from day one

## Frustrations / Pain Points

- **Premium shock at renewal** — after eight claim-free years Mohammed expected
  loyalty to be rewarded, not penalized with a 15% increase; the lack of
  transparency about why the premium increased erodes trust
- **Bonus portability anxiety** — he has heard conflicting information about
  whether bonus class transfers are guaranteed or discretionary, and fears
  losing years of earned discount in the switch
- **Coverage gap risk** — the timing of cancellation with If and start of
  coverage with TryggFörsäkring must be exact; any gap means driving without
  mandatory trafikförsäkring, which is illegal
- **Coverage comparison difficulty** — comparing what is actually covered under
  helförsäkring between two different insurers is nearly impossible from
  marketing materials alone; he wants a side-by-side IPID comparison
- **Trust in the new insurer** — Mohammed needs assurance that TryggFörsäkring
  will genuinely honor his claims history and not find reasons to downgrade
  his bonus class after onboarding

## Tech Comfort Level

**Medium.** Mohammed uses digital tools daily for his restaurant business —
point-of-sale systems, online accounting, staff scheduling apps — and is
comfortable with online self-service. However, for significant financial
decisions like insurance he prefers speaking to an advisor who can walk him
through the details. He would start the comparison process online but wants to
complete the switch with a human advisor, either by phone or at a local office.

## Regulatory Touchpoints

| Regulation | Relevance                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **FSA**    | Trafikförsäkring must be continuous with no coverage gap during the switch between insurers (FSA-007).                                                                              |
| **FSA**    | TFF manages the bonus class transfer process between Swedish insurers, ensuring Mohammed's class 6 is correctly transferred (FSA-008).                                              |
| **FSA**    | Mohammed has the right to cancel his If policy at huvudförfallodag with one month's written notice (FSA-013).                                                                       |
| **IDD**    | TryggFörsäkring must perform a demands-and-needs assessment for Mohammed as a new customer, even though he is an experienced policyholder switching from another insurer (IDD-001). |
| **IDD**    | Mohammed must receive an IPID for each TryggFörsäkring product tier so he can compare coverage with his existing If policy on a like-for-like basis (IDD-002).                      |
| **GDPR**   | Mohammed has the right to data portability — he can request his claims history and bonus documentation from If to facilitate the switch to TryggFörsäkring (GDPR-002).              |
