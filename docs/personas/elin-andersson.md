# Elin Andersson, 28 — Bostadsrättsinnehavare (BRF Tenant-Owner)

> _"I already pay BRF-avgift that includes building insurance. Why do I need a

## Avatar Description

A young woman in a modern apartment in Södermalm, Stockholm. The apartment is
small but stylishly furnished with a standing desk, multiple screens, a
high-end road bike mounted on the wall, and a cat sitting on a window ledge.
She is browsing insurance comparison sites on her laptop.

## Demographics

| Field      | Details                                             |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Age        | 28                                                  |
| Location   | Södermalm, Stockholm                                |
| Occupation | UX designer at a fintech startup                    |
| Income     | Mid-range, single income                            |
| Housing    | 2-room BRF apartment (48 m²), purchased 2 years ago |

## Insurance Situation

| Field            | Details                                                                             |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Current coverage | Basic hemförsäkring from a competitor; no bostadsrättstillägg                       |
| Property         | BRF apartment — the association's building insurance covers the structure           |
| Coverage goal    | Hemförsäkring with bostadsrättstillägg + allrisk/drulle for electronics and bicycle |
| Key concern      | Understanding the boundary between BRF building insurance and personal coverage     |
| Additional needs | Travel insurance add-on, identity theft protection                                  |

## Goals

- Understand exactly what the BRF's building insurance covers versus what she
  needs to insure herself (bostadsrättstillägg)
- Get allrisk/drulle coverage for her expensive electronics (MacBook Pro,
  external monitors) and road bike
- Complete the entire purchase journey digitally — no phone calls, no paper
- Find the best price-to-coverage ratio by comparing offers from multiple
  insurers

## Frustrations / Pain Points

- **Coverage boundary confusion** — the split between BRF building insurance
  and personal bostadsrättsförsäkring is unclear; who pays if the kitchen floor
  is damaged by a leak from upstairs?
- **Overpaying fear** — worried about paying for coverage that the BRF
  association already provides
- **Drulle limitations** — unclear what allrisk/drulle actually covers (does it
  cover dropping a laptop? spilling coffee on it? theft from a café?)
- **Comparison difficulty** — different insurers define bostadsrättstillägg
  differently, making apples-to-apples comparison hard

## Tech Comfort Level

**Very high (digital native).** Elin expects a fully digital experience from
start to finish: research, compare, purchase, manage, and file claims — all via
app or web. She authenticates with BankID on mobile and expects instant
confirmation. She will not call a phone line unless absolutely forced to. She
reads online reviews and uses comparison sites before making a decision.

## Regulatory Touchpoints

| Regulation | Relevance                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **IDD**    | A demands-and-needs assessment (IDD-001) must clarify what the BRF insurance covers and what Elin needs personally.                             |
| **IDD**    | The IPID (IDD-002) must clearly delineate bostadsrättstillägg coverage versus standard hemförsäkring.                                           |
| **IDD**    | Pre-contractual information (IDD-003) must explain allrisk/drulle limitations in plain language.                                                |
| **FSA**    | Elin has a 14-day cooling-off period for distance-sold policies (FSA-013).                                                                      |
| **FSA**    | Renewal terms and premium changes must be communicated in advance (FSA-004).                                                                    |
| **GDPR**   | Elin's personal data including property details and purchase history requires lawful processing and transparent privacy information (GDPR-001). |
| **GDPR**   | Elin has the right to data portability (GDPR-003), relevant when switching from her current insurer.                                            |
