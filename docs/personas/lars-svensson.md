# Lars Svensson, 55 — Claims Handler (Internal)

## Avatar Description

A middle-aged man in a collared shirt, sitting at a desk with dual monitors
showing a claims management interface. He has reading glasses pushed up on his
forehead and a coffee mug nearby. His expression is focused and experienced.

## Demographics

| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Age        | 55                                                  |

## Insurance Situation

Lars is not a customer — he is an internal user of the insurance platform. His
"insurance situation" is his professional context.

| Field             | Details                                                        |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Role              | Senior claims handler (skadereglerare)                         |
| Daily volume      | Processes 15–20 claims per day                                 |
| System experience | 20 years using the current legacy policy administration system |
| Specialization    | Motor vehicle damage claims, total loss assessments            |

## Goals

- Process claims efficiently with fewer manual steps and less switching between
  systems
- Have all relevant information (policy details, customer history, vehicle data,
  coverage limits) on one screen
- Easily document decisions and rationale for audit trails
- Reduce time spent on administrative tasks (data entry, form filling) and
  increase time spent on actual claims assessment
- Share knowledge with junior colleagues through structured processes rather
  than tribal knowledge

## Frustrations / Pain Points

- **Tribal knowledge dependency** — critical business rules exist only in Lars's
  head and those of a few senior colleagues; when he is on vacation, claims
  processing slows down
- **Legacy system workarounds** — the current system requires numerous manual
  workarounds (e.g., overriding fields that should not exist, using comment
  fields for structured data)
- **System fragmentation** — claims handling requires switching between the
  policy system, a separate claims system, email, Excel spreadsheets, and
  sometimes paper files
- **No decision support** — the system does not flag potential fraud indicators,
  suggest similar past claims, or validate coverage automatically
- **Training burden** — onboarding new claims handlers takes months because the
  process is undocumented and dependent on shadowing experienced staff

## Tech Comfort Level

**Medium.** Lars is proficient with the current legacy system (having used it
for 20 years) and standard office tools (Outlook, Excel). He is open to a new
system if it genuinely makes his job easier, but he is skeptical of change for
change's sake. He does not want a flashy interface — he wants a functional one
that supports his workflow. He is not comfortable with mobile interfaces for
work tasks and prefers a desktop application.

## Regulatory Touchpoints

| Regulation | Relevance                                                                                                                                                            |
